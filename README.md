* **State-Driven UI:** The app displays loading, success, and error states, providing clear feedback to the user.

* **Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** to separate UI from business logic.
* **Asynchronous Programming:** **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow** for managing background tasks and data streams.
* **Networking:** **Retrofit** for type-safe REST API calls to The Movie Database (TMDB).
* **Data Persistence:** **Jetpack DataStore** for storing user preferences asynchronously.
* **Dependency:** A manual ViewModel Factory was used to provide dependencies to ViewModels.
